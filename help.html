    <h2>Canvas Quiz Uploader</h2>
    <p>This Addon allows you to upload quiz questions to your Canvas courses. It uses a personal or school-configured access code so you don't have to copy and paste materials.</p>
    <p>To connect, go through the Setup steps in the Addon Menu.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>After you connect...</h2>
    <p>Once you connect your account, the Addon will automatically pull from your Canvas courses and quizzes. Questions are uploaded to existing quizzes, so <b>you need to create the Quiz in your course first.</b> This may be added as an improvement in the future.</p>
    <p>If you run into problems, you can request help by <a href="mailto:brian@ohheybrian.com">emailing the developer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bennettscience/canvas-lms-quiz-importer/issues" target="_blank">filing an issue</a>.
