Import Quiz questions to Canvas LMS from a a spreadsheet.

## What is it?

This Addon allows you to write quiz questions for import into Canvas. You can sign into your account, choose a class and an existing quiz for the import.

## Why?

Creating quiz items in Canvas is time consuming. This allows groups of people to work together on a Google Sheet to quickly create questions that can then be sorted into banks for use in multiple assessments. Questions can be added at any time and uploaded again with the same Addon.

## What doesn't it do?

You can't upload into Question Banks at this point. Each question is tagged by the content standard so you can log into your account and quickly move questions into banks.

## Installation

This is a self-hosted plugin for Canvas, so you may need help from your technical department.

### Register the app

The Addon needs to be registered in your Canvas account. This gives you access from the Google Sheet. **No data is stored by Google other than the API key used in your account.**

### Set the application ID and key

Once the app is registered, you can set up the Addon from your account. Paste the ID and key from your technical department into the setup box.

### Log in to Canvas

Type your Canvas web address into the box and save it. This will create a Login link you can use to authorize the app. Once that is done, reopen the Addon and start adding questions.
